make a simple app that lets admins login thru facebook for their access token

somehow get both types of access tokens potentially use the first one to get the other

once i have both access tokens the functionality can be performed

page owners can send their requests over firebase (since they're logged in already) and i will have a listener on server intercepting

listener will check database every 5 minutes for new requests (potentially less delay) and executes said ones

access tokens would be saved offline

have a way to distinguish pages from just their access tokens so you provide a certain service to each page

listen on pages dms






Services to offer:
> contact all clients with a message (potentially include buttons later in the app)
    > maybe 1 message for 250da, 5 messages for 690da, 10 messages for 1250da

> conversational replies
    > replies to detected keywords
    > replying with messages containing buttons (ex. calling functionality)
> chatbot admin mode :
    > the adding of a product by simply sending a photo/writing a name
        > must test how u can queue access to a database from two places
    > specifying keywords that the chatbot replies to
    > a set list of quick replies


Future:
> included app must allow :
    > links products from the page's website when specific keywords are detected
    > designing replies with buttons
    > setting up a quickreplies list
